## Language Used => Kotlin
Kotlin is a **cross-platform**, **statically typed**, **general-purpose** programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

Android mobile development has been **Kotlin-first** since **Google I/O in 2019**.

For More information about **Kotlin** and It's benefit with **Android Development** can be found [Here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/android-overview.html)

In this project **Kotlin Plugin** Version is:**1.3.50**

## Android Studio
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems. 

In this project **Android Studio** Version is: ***4.0.0**

## Gradle
Gradle is an open-source build automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language instead of the XML form used by Maven for declaring the project configuration
